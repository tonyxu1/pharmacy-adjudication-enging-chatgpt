# Pharmacy Adjudication Engine with help of ChatGPT
The purpose of this project is to test how much ChatGPT can help me to generate source code in a very specific business sector : healthcare pharmacy adjudication engine
## Background (AutoGenerated by ChatGPT)
The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) is a not-for-profit organization that develops standards for electronic prescribing and pharmacy-related transactions. Real-time adjudication (RTA) is a process where a pharmacy can electronically submit a prescription to a health plan for immediate processing and determination of coverage and payment.

The NCPDP has developed standards for RTA, which include the use of an adjudication engine. An adjudication engine is software that processes prescription claims and determines coverage and payment based on the patient's insurance plan and benefit design.

The NCPDP's RTA standards enable pharmacies to submit prescription claims electronically and receive immediate responses from health plans. This helps to reduce errors and improve efficiency in the pharmacy and insurance industries.

Overall, the use of an NCPDP pharmacy RTA engine helps to streamline the prescription claims process, ensure timely access to medications for patients, and improve communication between pharmacies and health plans.
